# SPARQL Endpoint interface to Python

The distribution contains:

* `SPARQLWrapper`: the Python library. You should copy the directory somewhere into your PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, you can also run the disutils scrips:

    python setup.py install

* `test`: some unit tests
  
* `script`: some scripts to run the library against some SPARQL end-points.
